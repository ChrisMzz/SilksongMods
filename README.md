# Chris Mzz.'s Silksong Mods

Here's my repository with the source code for mods I wrote for Hollow Knight: Silksong.

Although my mods are available on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/ChrisMzz/) and [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/profile/ChrisMzz/mods?gameId=8136), the Silksong modding community recommends using Thunderstore, so the hyperlinks in this repository will point there.

## Currently includes

- [Swap Crest On Hit](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/ChrisMzz/SwapCrestOnHit/): Swaps Hornet's crest every time she takes damage.
- [Menderbug's Haunting](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/ChrisMzz/MenderbugsHaunting/): Kills Hornet whenever she breaks a background object.
