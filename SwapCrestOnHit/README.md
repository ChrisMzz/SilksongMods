# SwapCrestOnHit

Swaps Hornet's crest every time she takes damage.
Currently swaps Hornet's active crest only with other unlocked crests. The mod ensures that the chest changes, so typically if you have two crests unlocked the crest will cycle between the two in a predictable way.

The loadout of each crest is *per-crest*, so you will alternate loadouts as you change crest when taking damage.

Plans for the future maybe:
 - Add a config option to swap with *any other valid crest in the game*, including Cloakless and Cursed crests, regardless of unlock status or in-game logic. 

## Install

1. Install [BepInEx5 with Configuration Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/26) and extract it to the folder with your game executable, then run the game and exit.
2. Download [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/879) and extract it in your `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

Then run the game and enjoy!
