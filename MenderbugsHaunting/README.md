# Menderbug's Haunting

> DISCLAIMER! This mod is an adaptation of flibber-hk's [Menderbug's Revenge](https://github.com/flibber-hk/HollowKnight.MenderbugsRevenge) for Hollow Knight. I did not come up with the idea but I wanted to see it in Silksong as well so I made this.

Menderbug is BACK in Silksong! Breaking anything will kill Hornet.
There's a config menu where you can set the damage Hornet receives to whatever number you like (including 0), but would you not want to repent for your crimes against Menderbug? Damage is set to 100 by default.

There are probably places in which the game becomes impossible, in which case please report it to me, in the meantime you can temporarily set the damage to 0 for any of those sections. 

## Install

1. Install [BepInEx5 with Configuration Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/26) and extract it to the folder with your game executable, then run the game and exit.
2. Download [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/881) and extract it in your `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

Then run the game and enjoy!
