# Menderbug's Haunting

> DISCLAIMER! This mod is an adaptation of flibber-hk's [Menderbug's Revenge](https://github.com/flibber-hk/HollowKnight.MenderbugsRevenge) for Hollow Knight. I did not come up with the idea but I wanted to see it in Silksong as well so I made this.

Menderbug is BACK in Silksong! Breaking anything will kill Hornet.
There's a config menu where you can set the damage Hornet receives to whatever number you like (including 0), but would you not want to repent for your crimes against Menderbug? Damage is set to 100 by default.

There are probably places in which the game becomes impossible, in which case please report it to me, in the meantime you can temporarily set the damage to 0 for any of those sections. 

## Install

1. Install the [BepInExPack](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Silksong/) for Silksong, following the instructions from over there.
2. Install [this mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/ChrisMzz/MenderbugsHaunting/).

(Optional) If you want to benefit from config options of the mod, also install [BepInExConfigurationManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/jakobhellermann/BepInExConfigurationManager/).

Then run the game and enjoy!
